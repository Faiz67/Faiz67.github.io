                <td>One of the biggest crisis of current times is the rapid growth of non-biodegradable waste
                    accumulated on
                    the earth which results in a number of ecological problems. Most of the waste disposed is recyclable
                    but
                    a very small amount of it is recycled leading to issues. The website helps connect the consumer to
                    the
                    recycler and vice-versa. The consumer can choose the kind of waste to dispose and enter their
                    location
                    and a pickup will be scheduled according to their convenience and they get to make money with little
                    effort put into it. The recyclers can join as vendors thus giving them a bigger consumer rate. The
                    idea
                    behind this is to educate and encourage more people to recycle their waste.

                <td>During the pandemic social distancing and checking of temperature before entering any shop/store has
                    become a need to ensure safety of customers and workers. All types of locations where people
                    congregate
                    to enforce social distancing and identify individuals with high temperatures on account of COVID-19.
                    In
                    response, technology providers have developed automated identity and temperature monitoring tools
                    that
                    allow locations to check people's temperatures. Store managers have to arrange a person simply for
                    checking temperature and ensuring that a limited number of people are inside the shop at any given
                    moment.
